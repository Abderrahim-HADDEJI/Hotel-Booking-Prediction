# Hotel-Booking-Prediction
Real World Data Science &amp; Machine Learning Project (Hotel Booking Prediction)
Through this project, we are going to build a hotel booking forecast on the project theme.
The basic purpose of this project is that we have different attributes and we have to predict whether the reservation has been canceled or not.

First, we will import our libraries, and then we will do an extensive exploratory analysis of the data, and Data Cleaning and data visualization 
Then we will do some Feature Engineering, in which we will do Data Preprocessing, after that we will build our model and we will compare different models ( RandomForestClassifier, XGBClassifier, LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier) and see what further precision we're going to get.
